.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fB\fCbashbud\fR can be used to quickly create new
scripts with cli\-option support and automatic
documentation applied.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\fC\-\-new\fR|\fB\fC\-n\fR
Creates a new project at TARGET\_DIR (\fIif
TARGET\_DIR doesnt exist, if it does script will
exit\fP), based on GENERATOR. If GENERATOR is
omitted the \fBdefault\fP generator will be used.
After all files are copied and linked, the project
is \fIbumped\fP (\fIsame as:\fP \fB\fCbashbud \-\-bump
TARGET\_DIR\fR).

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-bump\fR|\fB\fC\-b\fR
The current working direcory will be set as
PROJECT\_DIR if none is specified. When a project
is \fIbumped\fP,  \fB\fCbashbud\fR will read the
\fImanifest.md\fP file in PROJECT\_DIR, (\fIor exit if no
manifest.md file exists\fP). If a generator \fBtype\fP
is specified in the \fBfront matter\fP  (the \fIYAML\fP
section starting the document) of the
\fImanifest.md\fP file, that generator will be used to
update the project based on the content of the
\fImanifest.md\fP file and the \fImanifest.d\fP directory
(\fIif it exists\fP). If a directory named \fIbashbud\fP
exists within \fIPROJECT\_DIR\fP, that directory will
be used as a generator.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-link\fR|\fB\fC\-l\fR
Add any missing links from the generators
\fB\fC\_\_link\fR directory, to \fB\fCPROJECT\_DIR\fR\&.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-get\fR|\fB\fC\-g\fR KEY
Get the value from a key in the YAML frontmatter
of the manifest.md. If last argument is a
directory, the manifest in that directory will be
used, otherwise the current directory is assumed.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-set\fR|\fB\fC\-s\fR VALUE
Set the value of KEY in the YAML frontmatter of
the manifest.md to VALUE. If last argument is a
directory, the manifest in that directory will be
used, otherwise the current directory is assumed.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-help\fR|\fB\fC\-h\fR
Show help and exit.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-version\fR|\fB\fC\-v\fR
Show version and exit.

.PP

.SH bashbud project
.PP
A project in the bashbud context refers to a
directory and it's content that contains a
[manifest.md] file.


.SH the manifest
.PP
The manifest is the only mandatory thing
\fB\fCbashbud\fR needs to operate on a [project].  The
manifest consist of three parts:

.RS
.IP "  1." 5
comment area
.IP "  2." 5
front matter
.IP "  3." 5
manifest body

.RE

.PP
Below is an example of how a manifest can look
like:

.PP
\fBPROJECT\_DIR/manifest.md\fP

.PP
.RS

.nf
this is just an example
any text before the start of the front matter
will be ignored by bashbud and can be used to write comments.

.RE

.SH manifest front matter
.PP
The manifest front matter is the only mandatory
part of the manifest.  It needs to be defined
before the manifest body in the \fB\fCmanifest.md\fR
file, in [YAML] format (starting with three dashes
(\fB\fC\-\-\-\fR) and ending with thre dots (\fB\fC\&...\fR).

.PP
The front matter can contain any number of user
defined, variables, lists and arrays, but some
keys are special.

.SH special variables in the manifest front matter
.PP
The key \fB\fCgenerator\fR tells \fB\fCbashbud\fR what
[generator] to use, it is not mandatory and
defaults to: \fB\fCdefault\fR if omitted and is always
overridden by a [project specific generator].

.PP
Another special variable is [synopsis].

.SH the synopsis variable and options array
.PP
The key \fB\fCsynopsis\fR will be translated to an array
called \fIoptions\fP when parsed by \fB\fCbashbud\fR\&. If used
properly this will be the only place needed to
declare command\-line options in a \fIproject\fP\&. Let's
take a closer look at the \fB\fCsynopsis\fR key from the
example manifest above.

.PP
.RS

.nf
synopsis: |
    \-\-help|\-h [COMMAND]
    \-\-version|\-v
    \-\-new FILE **DIRECTORY**



.fi
.RE

.PP
The pipe (\fB\fC|\fR) character, after the key
definition, is [YAML] syntax meaning that the
content of the key should be interpreted literal.
Which in turn means it will preserve linebreaks as
they are written. The indentation specifies the
scope.

.PP
Translated to a \fB\fCbash\fR variable, it would look
like this:

.PP
.RS

.nf
synopsis'\-\-help|\-h [COMMAND]
\-\-version|\-v
\-\-new FILE **DIRECTORY**'



.fi
.RE

.PP
The above is also what would be printed if
\fB\fC%%synopsis%%\fR would be used in a [template].

.PP
But as mentioned, the content of the synopsis
will also get stored in a special array called
\fIoptions\fP:

.PP
.RS

.nf
options[help][long]=help
options[help][short]=h
options[version][long]=version
options[version][short]=v
options[new][long]=new
options[new][arg]=FILE



.fi
.RE

.PP
Notice that the option \fB\fC\-\-help\fR in the synopsis
have an \fIoptional\fP argument defined, (\fB\fC[COMMAND]\fR)
and that it is ignored in the array. Sometimes it
is also desired to have a mandatory argument,
that doesn't belong to the preceding option. Such
arguments should be enclosed withing double
asterisks (\fB\fC**DIRECTORY**\fR).

.SH manifest body
.PP
The manifest body is considered everything after
the manifest front matter in the \fB\fCmanifest.md\fR
file  \fBAND\fP the content of all files in the
directory \fB\fCmanifest.d\fR\&. The manifest body is used
to add more variables to the manifest,  but are
here written in markdown instead of YAML. The
reason for this is that it is more convenient to
write prose like text in markdown. Markdown
headings (lines starting with one or more hash:
\fB\fC#\fR) will be translated to variables, everything
between headings will be the content of the
variable. It is possible to add keys to arrays
created in the front matter, but it is not
possible to create new arrays in the manifest
body.

.PP
Below is a simple example:

.PP
\fBPROJECT\_DIR/manifest.md\fP

.RE

.PP
When \fB\fCbashbud\fR processes this project, the
following variables will be available in the
templates:

.PP
.RS

.nf
version='1.100'
created='2018\-12\-15'
updated='2018\-10\-06'
generator='default'

long\_description='This is just an **example** of how use the `manifest` in a *bashbud* project.'
options[help][long]=help
options[help][short]=h
options[help][description]='Print help information to stderr and exit'
options[version][long]=version
options[version][short]=v
options[version][description]='Print version information to stderr and exit'
options[new][long]=new
options[new][arg]=FILE
options[new][description]='Creates a new FILE'



.fi
.RE

.PP
Notice how the dash (\fB\fC\-\fR) in the headings in
\fBPROJECT\_DIR/manifest.d/options.md\fP  is used to
specify which array and key to use. Also take note
that the linebreak in the \fB\fClong\_description\fR
variable is translated to a space \&. This is
markdown syntax, to make a hard linebreak in
markdown end the line with two space characters or
add a blank line after the line to break.

.SH generators
.PP
A generator is a directory containing templates
and base files used to create or update (\fIbump\fP) a
project. When a new project is created (with the
\fB\fC\-\-new\fR option) \fB\fCbashbud\fR will do the following:

.RS
.IP "  1." 5
determine location of generator
\[la]#determine_location_of_generator\[ra]
.IP "  2." 5
copy base files
\[la]#copy_base_files\[ra]
.IP "  3." 5
create links
\[la]#copy_base_files\[ra]
.IP "  4." 5
process templates
\[la]#process_templates\[ra]

.RE

.PP
When a project is updated with the \fB\fC\-\-bump\fR
command\-line option, it will process the templates
and scripts corresponding to the projects
generator.


.SH generator types
.PP
A project can use one of three types of
generators:

.RS
.IP "  1." 5
Project specific generator (\fBPSG\fP)
.IP "  2." 5
User specific generator (\fBUSG\fP)
.IP "  3." 5
System wide generator (\fBSWG\fP)

.RE

.PP
The type is determined based on the generators
location. If the generator is not project specific
the value of the key: \fB\fCgenerator\fR in the projects
\fBmanifest\fP specifies which generator to use.

.PP
If no \fBPSG\fP exists and no value to the
\fB\fCgenerator\fR key in the manifest is declared. The
\fB\fCdefault\fR \fBSWG\fP will be used if no \fB\fCdefault\fR
\fBUSG\fP exists.


.SH Project specific generators (\fBPSG\fP)
.PP
A \fBPSG\fP is unique to a certain project. A
\fBPSG\fP is defined by creating a directory in a
projects root directory named \fB\fCbashbud\fR that
contain templates. This directory have the same
file structure as a \fB\fC\_\_templates\fR directory of a
\fBUSG\fP\&.

.PP
\fBPSG\fP have highest priority of generators and
is used if a \fBPSG\fP directory exist, even if the
\fB\fCgenerator\fR key in the \fBmanifest\fP have a value.

.PP
The purpose and advantage of using a \fBPSG\fP for
a project is that it makes the \fIbashbud build\fP
portable. Anyone can clone the project and use
\fB\fCbashbud \-\-bump\fR to get the same output. \fBPSG\fP
is the recommended generator type, especially for
public projects.

.PP
The disadvantage of using a \fBPSG\fP instead of
the other generator types:

.RS
.IP "  1." 5
A \fBPSG\fP is unique to a project, meaning that changes done to the generator will not apply to other bashbud generators. This can however be done by using [linked generators].
.IP "  2." 5
A \fBPSG\fP can not be used to create a new bashbud project, only update.

.RE

.PP
Below is an example of how the file tree would
look like in a project using a \fBPSG\fP:

.PP
.RS

.nf

            \_\_template

    manifest.d/
        ...
    manifest.md
    ...



.fi
.RE

.PP
When this project would get updated with the
\fB\fC\-\-bump\fR command\-line option,  the templates
within the subdirectories of the \fIbashbud\fP
directory would get get processed.


.SH user specific generators (\fBUSG\fP)
.PP
user specific generators are located in
\fIBASHBUD\_DIR\fP (which defaults to
\fB\fC\~/.config/bashbud\fR) in which a directory named
\fIgenerators\fP holds all available \fBUSG\fP\&.

.PP
Below is an example representation of the files
and directories in a \fBUSG\fP (and a \fBSWG\fP)

Two \fBUSG\fP exist in the filetree above:
\fB\fCdefault\fR and \fB\fCnextgen\fR\&. All files and directories
within the root directory of the generator
(\fIdefault\fP) that doesn't start with two
underscores are referred to in the documentation
as base files. The base files will get copied to
PROJECT\_DIR when the project is created with the
\fB\fC\-\-new\fR command\-line option.

PROJECT\_DIR.

.fi
.RE

.PP
The content of the \fB\fC\_\_templates\fR directory is
only used when a project is updated with the
\fB\fC\-\-bump\fR command\-line option. The \fB\fC\_\_templates\fR
directory is actually the only part of a generator
needed when a PROJECT is updated.  Since a \fBPSG\fP
can only be used to \fB\fC\-\-bump\fR a project,  a \fBPSG\fP
generator consists of only the \fB\fC\_\_templates\fR
directory, renamed to \fB\fCbashbud\fR and place in the
root of \fIPROJECT\_DIR\fP\&.


.SH system wide generator (\fBSWG\fP)
.PP
A \fBSWG\fP have the exact same file structure as a
[user specific generator], the only difference
being it's location in the filesystem.

.PP
A \fBSWG\fP is located in
\fB\fC/usr/share/bashbud/generators/\fR while a \fBUSG\fP
is located in \fB\fCBASHBUD\_DIR/generators/\fR\&.

.PP
If a both a \fBSWG\fP and a \fBUSG\fP have the same
name, \fBUSG\fP will have priority.

.PP
By default there only exist one \fBSWG\fP:
\fB\fCdefault\fR\&.


.SH linked generators
.PP
Creating a \fBUSG\fP (or a \fBSWG\fP), that instead
of having its templates located in
\fB\fCGENERATOR\_DIR/\_\_templates\fR, have them at
\fB\fCGENERATOR\_DIR/\_\_link/bashbud\fR\&. Will have the
effect that whenever a new project is created it
will have a \fBPSG\fP (\fB\fCPROJECT\_DIR/bashbud\fR), and
the templates being linked to
\fB\fCGENERATOR\_DIR/\_\_link/bashbud\fR\&. This solves the
issues of local projects not being able to share
templates while still being fully portable.  It is
also a way to use \fB\fC\-\-new\fR with \fBPSG\fP\&.

.PP
This is the recommended way of using bashbud.


.SH generator priority
.PP
The priority of generators is as follows:

.RS
.IP "  1." 5
project specific generator (\fBPSG\fP)
.IP "  2." 5
user specific generator (\fBUSG\fP)
.IP "  3." 5
system wide generator (\fBSWG\fP)

Notice how none of the lines are wrapped since
the files imported aren't markdown files with the
\fB\fCmd\fR extension.

.SH template order
.PP
To have templates being processed in a certain
order, place a file named \fB\fC\_\_order\fR in the
\fBtemplate directory\fP\&.

.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
.RS

.nf

This can be useful when the result of one
template is used in another.


.SH extension scripts
.PP
The functionality of \fBbashbud\fP can be extended
with scripts. Before and after some operations are
performed \fBbashbud\fP looks for files named and
located in certain places, if these files exist
and is executable, they will be executed.

.SH template scripts
.PP
A \fBtemplate script\fP needs to be named
\fB\fC\_\_script\fR  and placed in the same directory as a
\fB\fC\_\_template\fR file. It will get executed with full
path to the \fItarget\fP of the template as a command
line parameter. (\fIthe target is defined in the
front matter of the \_\_template\fP).

.SH EXAMPLE

When this project is updated with the \fB\fC\-\-bump\fR
command line option,  after the manual template

\fB\fCPROJECT\_DIR/bashbud/manual/\_\_script\fR will get
executed and the result will be:
\fB\fCPROJECT\_DIR/manual.md is generated\fR

.PP
The scripts doesn't have to be written in bash,
it should work as expected with f.i. python or
perl scripts as long as they are executable and
have the appropriate shebang.

.SH bump scripts
.PP
Whenever a project is updated with the \fB\fC\-\-bump\fR
command line option, \fBbashbud\fP will look for
executable files named \fB\fC\_\_post\-apply\fR and
\fB\fC\_\_pre\-apply\fR in the root of the templates
directory. \fB\fC\_\_pre\-apply\fR is executed before any
templates are processed. \fB\fC\_\_post\-apply\fR is
executed after all templates are processed. When
the scripts are executed, the full path to the new
project is passed.

.SH EXAMPLE

    {print}
' "$manifest"



.fi
.RE

.PP
This will increment the version number in the
manifest front matter +0.001 and update the
updated date, before any templates are processed.

.SH generator scripts
.PP
Whenever a project is created with the \fB\fC\-\-new\fR
command line option, \fBbashbud\fP will look for
executable files named \fB\fC\_\_post\-generate\fR and
\fB\fC\_\_pre\-generate\fR in the root of the generators
directory. \fB\fC\_\_pre\-generate\fR is executed before a
generated is created. \fB\fC\_\_post\-generate\fR is
executed after after a generator is created. When
the scripts are executed, the full path to the new
project is passed.
