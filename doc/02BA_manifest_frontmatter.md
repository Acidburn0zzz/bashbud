## manifest front matter

The manifest front matter is the only mandatory part of the manifest. 
It needs to be defined before the manifest body in the `manifest.md` file,
in [YAML] format (starting with three dashes (`---`) and ending with thre dots (`...`).  

The front matter can contain any number of user defined, variables, lists and arrays, but some keys are special and three of them are mandatory and autogenerated.

## mandatory manifest variables

When a new *bashbud project* is created with the command-line option `--new`,
`bashbud` will automatically fill out the current date according to the format defined in the environment variable: `BASHBUD_DATEFORMAT`,
in both the created and updated keys.
It will also set the version number to 0.000.
When a *bashbud project* is updated with the command-line option `--bump`,
the updated key will be set the to the current date
and the version number will be increased by 0.001.  

Therefor the version and updated keys are mandatory in the manifest front matter.

## special variables in the manifest front matter

The key `generator` tells `bashbud` what generator to use,
it is not mandatory and defaults to: `default` if omitted
and is always overridden by a [project specific generator].


Another special variable is [synopsis].
