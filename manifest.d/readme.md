**bashbud** works like a static site generator
(*hugo*,*jekyll*,*etc.*),
generating documents based on templates
with content written in markdown.  

**bashbud** was created to organize and structure bash script projects,
but it can be used to generate any type of document,
and be used for other programming (or non-programming) projects. 

It is written in **gawk** and **bash**.
**bashbud** itself is used to generate the documentation.
