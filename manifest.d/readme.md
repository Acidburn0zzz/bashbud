**bashbud** works like a static site generator
(*hugo*,*jekyll*,*etc.*),
generating documents based on templates
with content written in markdown.  

It is intended to be used for bash script projects,
but it can be used to genrate other type of documents.  

It is written in **AWK** and **BASH**.
**bashbud** itself is used to generate the documentation.
